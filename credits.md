I'd like to give thanks to everyone who contributed to the 5E rules over the years (including Jeremy Crawford, Chris Perkins, Rodney Thompson, Peter Lee, James Wyatt, Robert J. Schwalb, Bruce R. Cordell, Chris Sims, Steve Townshend, E. Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson).

I would also like to give thanks to David Black, Christian Mehrstam, Stephen J. Grodzicki, Michael Wolf, and the producers of [Quest](https://www.adventure.game), whose RPGs - including [The Black Hack](https://squarehex.myshopify.com/products/the-black-hack-2nd-rule-book), [The Whitehack](https://whitehackrpg.wordpress.com/), [Low Fantasy Gaming](https://lowfantasygaming.com/) and [Warrior, Rogue & Mage](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/michael-wolf/warrior-rogue-mage/paperback/product-1dnzr77j.html?page=1&pageSize=4) - inspired **Three Meet**.

**Three Meet** is built with JavaScript, CSS and Markdown, using open-source software including \<vellum-doc>, Node.js and NPM. It is hosted on Github Pages.
