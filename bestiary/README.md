## Morale

Rule

If a **Creature** is **Shocked** or reduced to half their **Stamina** or less they must make a **Morale Check**, which is an **Opposed Wisdom Save vs Mighty Intimidation Check**. **Loyal** creatures are **Proficient** in this check.

If they fail a **Morale Check** they attempt to retreat. **Loyal** creatures will **Disengage** first.
