I. Definitions.

a. Adapted Licensed Material means Derivative Works that Use all or any portion of the Licensed

otherwise constitute those forms of Licensed Material set forth in Section I.e.(2) below.
Adapted Licensed Material expressly excludes works that would constitute Reserved Material.
b. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to
copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui
Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. In no
event shall Copyright and Similar Rights include trademark or patent rights.
c. Derivative Work means: (i) for a product that Uses a single playable game system, the entire
product published by or on behalf of You that is based on, derived from, or incorporates all or
any portion of the Licensed Material; and (ii) for products containing sections relating to
multiple non-interoperable game systems (such as a magazine featuring sections regarding
multiple unrelated games from different publishers or a website with portions related to
different games) the entire portion of the product related to or derived from the Licensed
Material shall constitute the Derivative Work.
d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper
authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the
WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
agreements.
e. Licensed Material means (1) any material contained in a Work that would otherwise constitute
Reserved Material but that has been expressly designated as Licensed Material by that

and methods of operation of a game that are contained in a Work that are comprised of systems,
procedures, processes, rules, laws, instructions, heuristics, routines, functional elements,
commands, structures, principles, methodologies, operations, devices, and concepts of play,
and the limitations, restraints, constraints, allowances, and affordances inherent in gameplay,
including but not limited to expressions describing the function of or providing instructions as
to the following:

chance, creating or filling in character sheets, moving and interacting with tokens or
figurines, drawing maps and illustrations, speaking, messaging, acting, pantomime, writing
notes, asking questions, and making statements).

The term Licensed Material shall in no event include Third Party Reserved Material. For the
avoidance of doubt, the term Licensed Material is intended to exclude Reserved Material except
to the limited extent a Licensor has expressly designated content that would otherwise
constitute their Reserved Material as Licensed Material pursuant to notice published under

Article III.

f. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this
ORC License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your Use of
the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
g. Licensor means any individual or entity granting rights under this ORC License.
h. Reserved Material means trademarks, trade dress, and creative expressions that are not
essential to, or can be varied without altering, the ideas or methods of operation of a game
system, including works of visual art, music and sound design, and clearly expressed and
sufficiently delineated characters, character organizations, dialogue, settings, locations, worlds,
plots, or storylines, including proper nouns and the adjectives, names, and titles derived from
proper nouns. The term Reserved Material shall in no event include elements that have been
previously expressly designated as Licensed Material by that material’s Licensor, that are
Adapted Licensed Material, that constitute Third Party Reserved Material, or that are in the
public domain.
i. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive
96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent
rights anywhere in the world.
j. Term means the longer of the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed herein.
k. Third Party Reserved Material means all intellectual property rights that are not or have not
been licensed under the ORC License and that are neither owned nor controlled by Licensor or
You or any person or entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with You or Licensor.
l. Use or Used means to use material by any means or process that requires permission under the
Licensed Rights, such as production, reproduction, creation of derivative works, public display,
public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make
material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the
material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
m. Work or Works means that where a Licensor applies notice substantially in the form described
in Section III to a product, (i) for products containing a single playable game, the entire product
published by Licensor shall constitute the Work, and (ii) for products containing sections
relating to multiple non-interoperable games (such as a magazine featuring sections regarding
multiple unrelated games from different publishers or a website with portions related to
different games) the entire portion of the product related to or derived from the Licensed
Material shall constitute the Work.
n. You or Your means the individual or entity exercising rights granted under this ORC License.
II. Grants & Limitations.
a. Primary Grant to You. Subject to the terms and conditions of this ORC License, for the Term
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to Use the Licensed
Material, in whole or in part that may be terminated only as set forth in Section V.a. for Your
breach. Licensor hereby authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
necessary to do so. Licensor hereby waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to
forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,
including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures.
3
b. Grant of Adapted Licensed Material by You. You hereby receive an offer from the Licensor
to exercise the Licensed Rights on the express condition that You do and hereby grant to every
recipient of the Adapted Licensed Material an irrevocable offer to exercise the Licensed Rights
in the Adapted Licensed Material under the terms and conditions hereof pursuant to which such
Adapted Licensed Material shall be licensed as Licensed Material to such recipient. You may
not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on the Licensed Material or
apply any Effective Technological Measures to the Licensed Material if doing so restricts
exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
c. Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply
to Your Use of the Licensed Material, this ORC License grants You the right to extract, reuse,
reproduce, and Use all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database, and if You
include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have
Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights
(but not its individual contents) shall constitute Adapted Licensed Material.
d. Limitations.
i. Nothing in this ORC License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or
imply that You are, or that Your Use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or
sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to
receive attribution hereunder.
ii. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this ORC License, nor
are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent
possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the
Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but
not otherwise.
iii. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the
exercise of the Licensed Rights and Use of the Licensed Material, whether directly or
through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme.
III. Required Notice. The grant of this ORC License to You is expressly conditioned on You including
the notice statements described in subsections (a)–(d) below in a reasonable manner based on the
medium, means, and context in which You Used the Licensed Material:
a. ORC Notice. The following statement designating the location and the terms of this ORC
License:
This product is licensed under the ORC License located at the Library of
Congress at TX 9-307-067 and available online at various locations. All
warranties are disclaimed as set forth therein.
b. Attribution Notice.
i. A statement based on reasonable, good-faith efforts that identifies each Licensor or creator
of the Licensed Material You Used and any others designated to receive attribution,
including all upstream licensors of Licensed Material upon which Your Adapted Licensed
Material is based or derived from, worded in any accurate and reasonable manner so
requested by such parties. Such credit may be named, anonymous, or a reasonable
pseudonym. For the avoidance of doubt, both Licensor and all parties similarly credited
under Licensor’s attribution notice should be included in Your attribution notice unless
otherwise reasonably indicated by such parties.
ii. A statement indicating how You wish to be reasonably credited with respect to the Adapted
Licensed Material licensed by You under this ORC License, including anonymously or by
pseudonym if designated. Licensors and creators may update their name, anonymity
designation, or pseudonym from time-to-time by notice to You and other known licensees
hereunder; however, such change shall in no event require You to halt distribution of any
4
Works You have produced or destroy any produced Works or Works-in-progress, but shall
merely require You to use good faith efforts to implement the requested change on a going
forward basis.
c. Reserved Material Notice. A statement based on reasonable, good-faith efforts that identifies
the elements of Your Reserved Material, if any, contained in the Derivative Work in which You
Use the Licensed Material. For avoidance of doubt, such designation neither limits Your rights
in Your Reserved Material nor limits any downstream licensee’s Use of the Adapted Licensed
Material. In the event of a conflict between Your designation of Reserved Material and the
definition of Licensed Material, the definition shall control.
d. Expressly Designated Licensed Material. A statement that identifies any elements of Your
content that would otherwise constitute Reserved Material contained in Your Derivative Work
that You agree to offer to prospective licensees under the ORC License as Licensed Material
pursuant to Section I.e.(1) above.
e. Sample Notice. By way of example only, the following notice would comply with the
requirements of this ORC License:
ORC Notice This product is licensed under the ORC License located at the Library of
Congress at TX 9-307-067 and available online at various locations
including [possible domain names may be inserted] and others.
All warranties are disclaimed as set forth therein.

Reserved
Material
Reserved Material elements in this product include, but may not be limited
to: The Skeleton Krew, The Horrible Nation of Funeralia, The Order of
Ossuaries & Edgelords, and all elements designated as Reserved Material
under the ORC License.
Expressly
Designated
Licensed
Material
The following elements are owned by the Licensor and would otherwise
constitute Reserved Material and are hereby designated as Licensed
Material: The Bardic Order of the Singing Skull and associated characters,
locations, and titles.
IV. Warranty & Limitation of Liability. Licensor warrants, represents, acknowledges, and agrees
that upon publication of Required Notice in a Licensor Work, Licensor may not thereafter withdraw,
modify, or revoke such offer to license the Licensed Material hereunder as to any existing licensee
or any prospective licensee, and Licensor’s offer to license such Licensed Material is irrevocable.
Licensor licenses the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or
warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or
other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence
of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed
in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. To the extent possible, in no event will the
5
Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or
otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other
losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this ORC License or use of the Licensed Material,
even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages.
Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a
manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver
of all liability.
V. Other Terms & Conditions.
a. Termination & Remedies. Your license to Use the Licensed Material will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with the terms and condition of this ORC License. Your
license will be reinstated, effective as of the date of termination, if You cure such violation on
a going forward basis (without the obligation to destroy inventory on hand) within 60 days of
Your discovery of the violation or if Licensor waives such violation in writing. No such
termination shall affect, limit, or disrupt the rights of any Licensor or downstream licensee of
any Licensed Material under any ORC License. Only the Licensor and Licensor’s upstream
licensors under this ORC License (which You are deemed to be in privity herewith) may bring
enforcement action against You hereunder. This constitutes a limitation on Licensor remedies
with respect to the license grant in the Licensed Material hereunder; however, this ORC License
neither limits Licensor’s remedies in any way with respect to Licensor’s Reserved Material,
nor does it limit Licensor’s right to offer the Licensed Material or Reserved Material under
separate terms or conditions.
b. Modifications. This ORC License may not be amended, superseded, modified, updated,
repealed, revoked, or deauthorized. Neither You nor Licensor may modify the terms of this
ORC License; however, You may enter into a separate agreement of Your own making provided
such agreement does not seek to modify the terms hereof. This ORC License does not, and
shall not be interpreted to reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed
Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this ORC License.
c. Construction. This ORC License is published simultaneously with an answers and
explanations document (“AxE”) that is filed under the same US Copyright registration as this
ORC License. One purpose of the AxE is to provide a general indication of the drafters’
intentions in interpreting the ORC License and in the event of a dispute, the AxE is intended to
be admissible to and used by any adjudicating body for such purpose. The ORC License may
be translated into other languages. You and Licensor acknowledge and agree that if there is any
conflict between this ORC License, the AxE, and such translated version, the terms of the
English language ORC License registered by Azora Law PLLC with the US Copyright Office
shall control. Subsequent versions of the AxE shall not be admissible for purposes of
determining the drafters’ intentions with respect to the ORC License. To the extent possible, if
any provision of this ORC License is deemed unenforceable by a court of law, it shall be
automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable on a case-by-
case basis. If such provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this ORC License
without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. No term or
condition of this ORC License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless
expressly agreed to by the Licensor. Nothing in this ORC License constitutes or may be
interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the
Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
