# Design Notes

The rules have been been adapted from 5E for low/grimdark fantasy. Modified as follows:

<section class="summaries">

<section class="summary">

### Low Powered

Classes aren't as powerful. You can only advance to 10th level. And the distinction between long and short rest features has been removed, in favour of short rest features only. All rests are now 8 hours.

</section>

<section class="summary">

### Low Magic

Magic isn't so flashy and is capped at 5th levels spells, and higher level spells are extremely rare.

Magical creatures are extremely rare, and many mechanics from spells and monsters have been moved to non-magical PC features and NPC traits.

</section>

<section class="summary">

### Meaningful Terms

5E comes with a lot of obscure terminology, like HP, saving throws and AC. Three Meet uses natural language terms, such as [Health](pages/combat/health.md) or [Saves](pages/rules/rolling/saves.md).

</section>

<section class="summary">

### Simplified Attributes

I've always found the 5E ability scores confusing and ambiguous.

In **Three Meet** ability scores have been merged into three [Attributes](pages/characters/attributes.md): [Might](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=might) (Strength and Constitution), [Cunning](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=cunning) (Dexterity and Charisma), and [Wisdom](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=wisdom) (Intelligence and Wisdom).

</section>

<section class="summary">

### No Races

Avoiding issues with traditional races, **Three Meet** does away with them. We remove races from the rules. Instead, [Backgrounds](pages/backgrounds/index.md) provide these kinds of features, gained through lived experience, training, and fortune.

</section>

<section class="summary">

### Utility Features in Backgrounds

Utility features have been removed from classes, and moved to [Backgrounds](pages/backgrounds/index.md). [Class](pages/class/index.md) features are combat-related only.

The intention is that [Backgrounds](pages/backgrounds/index.md) provide the fictional archetypes, while [Classes](pages/classes/index.md) focus on combat-related features.

</section>

<section class="summary">

### Abstract Details

5E involves a lot of fiddling about with distances in feet, large piles of coins, and long lists of equipment.

**Three Meet** abstracts these details, simplifying combat through theatre of the mind, and simplifying resource management.

</section>

<section class="summary">

### 1st-Level Sub-classes

All classes can be specialised at 1st-level, so players can have create the character concept they want without having to level up.

For this reason the classes have been consolidated into three classes: [The Mighty](pages/classes/mighty.md), [The Cunning](pages/classes/cunning.md), and [The Wise](pages/classes/wise.md).

</section>

<section class="summary">

### Short and Clear

**Three Meet** aims to condense the rules as clearly and simply as possible.

As part of this, we avoid hand holding, and assume you are familiar with common tabletop RPG concepts, such as <q>What is a Roleplaying Game?</q>

</section>

<section class="summary">

### 5E Core

Except for the above, we try to keep to the solid core of the 5E rules.
