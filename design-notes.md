# Design Notes

The rules have been been adapted from 5E for low/grimdark fantasy. Simplified and nerfed as follows:

### Meaningful Terms

Traditional roleplaying games come with a lot of baggage. We have obscure terminology like HP, saving throws and AC. Three Meet challenges these conventions to make the game more accessible. For example, hit points are now [Health](pages/combat/health.md). Saving throws are known as [saves](pages/rules/rolling.md?id=saves).

### Simplified Attributes

I've always found the standard ability scores (Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom and Intelligence) confusing and ambiguous.

In Three Meet ability scores have been merged into three [attributes](pages/characters/attributes.md): [Might](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=might), [Cunning](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=cunning) and [Wisdom](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=wisdom).

### Low-Powered Classes

Classes aren't as powerful. You can only advance to 10th level and with class features more spread out. There are only short rest features, and only one kind of [rest](pages/rules/rests.md).

### No Races

Avoiding issues with traditional races, Three Meet does away with them. Instead [backgrounds](pages/backgrounds/index.md) have been expanded to include utility features that represent cultural or environmental traits. This also means classes can focus on their core concepts.
