**Defence** determines how difficult you are to hit:

 + Your base **Defence** is determined by your [Armour](../../pages/equipment/armour.md)
 + If you're not wearing armour it is 10
 + Shields and other equipment can improve your **Defence**
 + Add your [Cunning](../../pages/characters/attributes.md#cunning) to your **Defence**

## Criticals

When you roll a **20** on an **Attack** you score a **Critical**. Roll all of the attackâ€™s damage dice twice and add them together.
