# Order of Combat

<p class="subheading">Rule</p>

</header>

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting.

The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns:

  + A **Round** represents about 6 seconds
  + During a round, each participant takes a **Turn**

The order of combat is as follows:

 1. Establish where all the characters and monsters are located.
 2. Roll [Initiative](pages/combat/order.md?id=initiative) to determine the order of combatants' turns.
 3. Each participant takes a **Turn** in initiative order.
 4. On your **Turn** you can take one [Move](pages/combat/moves.md), one [Attack](pages/combat/attacks.md), and one [Bonus Action](pages/combat/bonus-actions.md).
 4. When everyone has had a **Turn**, the **Round** ends.
 5. Repeat step 3 until fighting stops.

## Initiative

<p class="subheading">Rule</p>

**Initiative** determines the order of turns during combat:

 + When combat starts, every participant makes a [Cunning](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=cunning) [Check](pages/rules/rolling/checks.md).
 + This determines their place in the **Initiative** order.
 + The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures.
 + Combatants act in order, from the highest to the lowest initiative.
 + Initiative order remains the same from round to round.
 + If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order.
