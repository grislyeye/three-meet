# Order of Combat

<p class="subheading">Rule</p>

</header>

Combat is a clash between two sides, organized in a cycle of **Round** and turns. During a **Round**, each participant takes a **Turn**

The order of combat is as follows:

  1. Roll [Initiative](pages/combat/order.md?id=initiative).
  2. Each participant takes a **Turn** in initiative order.
  3. On your **Turn** you can take:
    - One [Action](pages/combat/actions.md)
    - One [Move](pages/combat/moves.md)
    - And one [Bonus Action](pages/combat/bonus-actions.md).
  4. When everyone has had a **Turn**, the **Round** ends.
  5. Repeat Step 3 until fighting stops.

## Initiative

**Initiative** is a [Cunning](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=cunning) [Check](pages/rules/rolling/checks.md). It determines the order of turns (highest to lowest) during combat:

 + The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures.
 + If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order.
