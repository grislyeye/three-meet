# Order of Combat

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting.

The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns:

  + A **round** represents about 6 seconds
  + During a round, each participant takes a **turn**

The order of combat is as follows:

 1. Establish where all the characters and monsters are located
 2. Roll [initiative](pages/combat/order.md?od=initiative) to determine the order of combatants' turns.
 3. Each participant takes a turn in initiative order
 4. On your turn you can take one [move](pages/combat/moves.md) and one [attack](pages/combat/attacks.md)
 4. When everyone has had a turn, the round ends
 5. Repeat step 3 until fighting stops

## Initiative

**Initiative** determines the order of turns during combat:

 + When combat starts, every participant makes a [Cunning](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=cunning) [check](pages/rules/rolling.md?id=checks)
 + This determines their place in the initiative order
 + The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures
 + Combatants act in order, from the highest to the lowest initiative
 + Initiative order remains the same from round to round
 + If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order
