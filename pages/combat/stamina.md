# Stamina

**Stamina** represent a combination of physical and mental durability, grit, willpower, and just plain luck:

 + When a creature takes damage, it is subtracted from its **Stamina**.
 + When a creature drops to 0 **Stamina** it dies.

### Damage

**Stamina** damage is abstract. It doesn't just represent physical harm. It can represent mental stress, off-balance, misfortune, shock,

A successful [Attack](pages/combat/attacks.md) might translate to a near miss that knocks you off-balance, a palpating fear you're outmatched, a light scratch, or temporary concussion. And, of course, a direct hit.
