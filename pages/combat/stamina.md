  Stamina replaces the abstruse term HP. It also encapsulates the idea that damage is abstract.

# Stamina

**Stamina** represent a combination of physical and mental durability, grit, willpower, and just plain luck:

 + When a creature takes damage, it is subtracted from its **Stamina**.
 + When a creature drops to 0 **Stamina** it dies.

### Damage

**Stamina** damage is abstract. It doesn't just represent physical harm. It can represent mental stress, off-balance, misfortune, or shock.

A successful [Attack](pages/combat/attacks.md) might translate to a near miss that knocks you off-balance, a palpating fear you're outmatched, a light scratch, or temporary concussion. Or, of course, a direct hit.

### Temporary Stamina

Some spells and special abilities confer **Temporary Stamina**. When you have Temporary Stamina and take damage, the Temporary Stamina is lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal Stamina.

**Temporary Stamina**:

  * Can exceed your Stamina maximum.
  * Cannot be restored.
  * Does not stack: if you receive more Temporary Stamina, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones.
  * They last until they're depleted, or you finish a long rest.
