# Stamina

Rule

**Stamina** represent a combination of physical and mental durability, grit, willpower, and just plain luck:

 + When a creature takes **Stress**, it is subtracted from its **Stamina**.
 + When a creature drops to 0 **Stamina** it dies.

## Stress

Rule

**Stamina** damage is abstract. It doesn't just represent physical harm. It can represent mental stress, off-balance, misfortune or shock.

A successful [Attack](../../pages/combat/attacks.md) might translate to a near miss that knocks you off-balance, a palpating fear you're outmatched, a light scratch, or temporary concussion. Or, of course, a direct hit.

## Out of Action

Rule

When you lose all your **Stamina** you are **Out of Action** and are unable to participate in the ongoing situation.

You can recover when you:

 * Gain **Stamina**
 * Are stabilised using the [Medicine Skill](../../pages/characters/skills.md#medicine)
 * Take a [Rest](../../pages/rules/rests.md)

When the fight is over/are out of danger, you must roll for an [Affliction](../../pages/combat/afflictions.md) to see what happened to you.
