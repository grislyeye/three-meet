# Combat

Rule

**Combat** is a clash between two sides, organized in a cycle of **Round** and turns. During a **Round**, each participant takes a **Turn**

The order of combat is as follows:

  1. Roll [Initiative](../../pages/combat/index.md#initiative).
  2. Each participant takes a **Turn** in initiative order.
  3. On your **Turn** you can take:
    - One [Action](../../pages/combat/actions.md)
    - One [Move](../../pages/combat/moves.md)
    - And one [Bonus Action](../../pages/combat/bonus-actions.md).
  4. When everyone has had a **Turn**, the **Round** ends.
  5. Repeat Step 3 until fighting stops.

## Surprise

Rule

If you're surprised at the start or combat, you can't move or take an **Action** on your first turn. The GM determines who might be surprised. Often this is resolved with a **Cunning [Stealth](../../pages/characters/skills.md#stealth) vs Cunning [Perception](../../pages/characters/skills.md#perception) [Contest](../../pages/rules/rolling/contests.md)**.

## Initiative

Rule

**Initiative** is a [Cunning](../../pages/characters/attributes.md?id=cunning) [Check](../../pages/rules/rolling/checks.md). It determines the order of turns (highest to lowest) during combat:

 + The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures.
 + If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order.
