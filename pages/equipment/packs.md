# Equipment Packs

<p class="subheading">Rule</p>

</header>

Rather than track every single item of inventory, many items are abstracted using **Packs**. A **Pack** is a [Resource](../../pages/rules/usage.md) that represents a container or stash of items.

 * When you want to see if you have an item appropriate for your **Pack**, **Tap** it.
 * If you **Deplete** your **Pack** you do not have that item.
 * You can **Replenish** your **Pack** at a suitable settlement with a **Treasure** item of the same [Usage Die](../../pages/rules/usage.md)

Some example packs include:
