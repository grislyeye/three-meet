# Retainers

<p class="subheading">Rule</p>

</header>

**Retainers** are non-player characters that support your character. Your relationship with your retainers is measured using a [Usage Die](pages/rules/usage.md).

  * You must **Tap** your **Retainer** when you test their loyalty.
  * To **Replenish** your **Retainer**, you can **Tap** your **Wealth**. Some other **Resources** also allow you to **Replenish** your **Retainer**.

Retainers are described with a name, followed by usage die and available actions in brackets. For example:
