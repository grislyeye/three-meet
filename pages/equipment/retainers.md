# Retainers

Rule

**Retainers** are non-player characters that support your character. Your relationship with your retainers is measured using a [Usage Die](pages/rules/usage.md).

  * You must **Tap** your **Retainer** when you test their loyalty.
  * If you **Deplete** your **Retainer** they refuse to do as you ask.
  * To **Replenish** your **Retainer**, you can **Tap** your **Treasure**. Other **Resources** also allow you to **Replenish** a **Retainer**.

Retainers are described with a name, followed by usage die and available actions in brackets. For example:

## Describing Retainers

Rule

Retainers are described with a standard stat block format:

The sub-heading details the the retainer's [Usage Die](pages/rules/usage.md) and it's [Proficiency](../../pages/rules/proficiency.md) and base roll bonus in parenthesis.

This might be followed by a short description of the character.

Next are the basic combat stats (Defence and Stamina). After that are the retainers features: the [Actions](../../pages/combat/actions.md), [Attacks](../../pages/combat/attacks.md) and other traits.
