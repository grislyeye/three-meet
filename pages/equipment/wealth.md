# Wealth

<p class="subheading">Rule</p>

</header>

Wealth is measured by abstract **Treasure** items: consumable treasures and containers for coins or jewels, such as pouches of coins or gold statues.

  * Each item of **Treasure** is a resource with a [Usage Die](pages/rules/usage.md) which you can **Tap** to buy goods, equipment, and services.
  * Items or services have a die cost, representing its relative price.
  * You do not have a treasure item with a [Usage Die](pages/rules/usage.md) higher than an item's cost, you cannot afford to buy it.

For example, you might have a d4 small pouch for of copper pieces or 6 pouches stuffed full of gold coins (**Ud6** each):

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="numbers">Usage Die</th>
      <th>Wealth Item</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="numbers">d4</td>
      <td>A handful of copper pieces</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="numbers">d6</td>
      <td>Small pouch containing silver florins</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="numbers">d8</td>
      <td>Large pouch stuffed full gold crowns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="numbers">d10</td>
      <td>Small chest full of gold</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="numbers">d12</td>
      <td>Large chest full of jewels</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="numbers">d20</td>
      <td>Dragon's hoard</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Variant: Large Wealth

You automatically buy items more than two levels down the usage die chain, without having to roll.

For example, if you have a d10 chest of gold coins, you do not have to roll your usage die if you buy a d4 dagger.
