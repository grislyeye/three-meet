# Wealth

Wealth is measured by abstract **Treasure** items: consumable treasures and containers for coins or jewels, such as pouches of coins or gold statues.

 * Each **Treasure** is a resource with a [Usage Die](pages/rules/usage.md) which you can **Tap** to buy goods, equipment, and services.

 * Examples of **Treasure** include: **Handful of Pennies (Treasure Ud4)**, **Small Pouch of Florins (Treasure Ud8)**, or even a **Dragon's Hoard (Treasure Ud20)**.

 * Items or services have a die cost, representing its relative price. If you do not have enough a treasure item with a usage die higher than an item's cost, you cannot afford to buy it.

### Variant: Large Wealth

You automatically buy items more than two levels down the usage die chain, without having to roll.

For example, if you have a d10 chest of gold coins, you do not have to roll your usage die if you buy a d4 dagger.
