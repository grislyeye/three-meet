### Thieves' Cant

You know thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.
