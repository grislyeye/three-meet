### Memory of Ages

<p class="subheading">1st-level Immortal speciality feature</p>

You're forgotten more than most folk know, more than you remember yourself. You can spend 10 minute searching your memories to gain proficiency in one [Skill](../../pages/characters/skills.md) or language. The memory of this knowledge fades once you take a **Rest**. You must **Rest** before you can use this feature again.
