# Outcast

You are an undesirable. Not exactly a criminal. Perhaps you didn't even break any laws. Nevertheless, you were banished from lawful society, forced into hiding or exile. You might have found like-minded individuals, fallen in with a bad crowd or become the victim of other outcasts.

Now your heart burns and aches all at once. How dare they exile you! How will you survive? Will you have your revenge? Or will you build something new beyond the bounds of society?
