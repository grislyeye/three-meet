# Rolling

In Three Meet you'll be asked to roll d4s, d8s, d10s, d12s, d20s and d100s. There are three main rolls:

 * [checks](pages/rules/rolling.md?id=checks)
 * [saves](pages/rules/rolling.md?id=saves)
 * [attacks](pages/combat/attacks.md)

## Checks

These depend on one of your attributes. When asked to make a **check**:

  1. The GM determines the difficulty, which attributes apply and if you are proficient
  1. Roll a d20
  2. Add your attribute
  3. Add your [Proficiency](pages/rules/proficiency.md) if you are proficient:
   1. If the total is greater than the difficulty you succeed
   2. If it is equal to or less you fail

Rolls can be modified by [advantage/disadvantage](pages/rules/advantage.md) or disadvantage.

## Difficulty

The **difficulty** of task is represented by a number. The most common difficulties are as follows:

| Description       | Difficulty  |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Very easy         | 5           |
| Easy              | 10          |
| Medium            | 15          |
| Hard              | 20          |
| Very hard         | 25          |
| Nearly impossible | 30          |

For example, Roche is attempting to fast-talk a suspicious guard. The GM asks him make a [Cunning](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=cunning) [check](pages/rules/rolling.md?id=checks) with Deception skill, against a difficulty of 13. Roche rolls an 8. His [Cunning](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=cunning) is +2 and he is proficient in Deception so he gets a total of 12.

He fails the roll, and the guard remains unconvinced.

A **check** tests your innate talent and training to overcome a challenge.

## Saves

A **save** represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat.

When you are asked to make a **save**, make a [check](pages/rules/rolling.md?id-checks) to avoid harm.

The difficulty is determined by the threat. For example, the power of a spell. the concentration of a poison or virulence of the disease.

Success means you avoid the threat, or suffer reduced harm.
