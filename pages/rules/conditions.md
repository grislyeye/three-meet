## Infamy

Condition (optional)

**Infamy** is a [Resource](../../pages/rules/usage.md) that tracks your notoriety. It must be [Tapped](../../pages/rules/usage.md) whenever you draw unwanted attention. You can also **Tap** it and add the result to any [Check](../../pages/rules/checks.md) to hide or evade authorities. When it is [Exhausted](../../pages/rules/usage.md) you are wanted and can no longer walk around without drawing attention.

## Corrupted

<p class="subheading">Condition</p>

**Corrupted** is a [Resource](../../pages/rules/usage.md) that tracks your diminishing humanity. It's **Tapped** each time you make a corrupted action, such as using ruinous magic or using a cursed magic item.

Each time it is **Exhausted** you undergo an unpleasant transformation. Roll on the Corruptions table below. Your Corruption then **Replenishes** at the next lower die. It stays at Ud4 once you reach Ud4.
