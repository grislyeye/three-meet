# Advantage/ Disadvantage

Some spells and special abilities can give you **advantage** or **disadvantage** on [checks](pages/rules/rolling.md?id=checks), [saves](pages/rules/rolling.md?id=saves), or [attacks](pages/combat/attacks.md).

The GM may also determine if circumstances give advantage or disadvantage.

When you roll with advantage or disadvantage:

 1. Roll two d20s instead of one:
  1. If you have advantage use the higher of the rolls, or
  2. If you have disadvantage use the lower
 4. Advantage and disadvantage do not stack: you either have one, or you don't
 5. Advantage and disadvantage cancel out: if you have both roll normally

For example, with advantage:

<div class="example-roll">
  <div class="roll">
    <img src="assets/images/d20.svg" style="width: 100px;">
    <span class="result">5</span>
  </div>
  <div class="roll">
    <img src="assets/images/d20.svg" style="width: 100px;">
    <span class="result">16</span>
  </div>
  =
  16
</div>

With disadvantage:

<div class="example-roll">
  <div class="roll">
    <img src="assets/images/d20.svg" style="width: 100px;">
    <span class="result">20</span>
  </div>
  <div class="roll">
    <img src="assets/images/d20.svg" style="width: 100px;">
    <span class="result">9</span>
  </div>
  =
  9
  </div>
