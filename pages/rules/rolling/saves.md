# Saves

Rule

A **Save** represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat.

When you are asked to make a **Save**, make a [Check](../../pages/rules/rolling/checks.md) to avoid harm.

The [Difficulty](../../pages/rules/rolling/checks.md#difficulty) is determined by the threat. For example, the power of a spell, the concentration of a poison, or virulence of the disease.

Success means you avoid the threat, or suffer reduced harm.
