# Checks

<p class="subheading">Rule</p>

</header>

A **Check** tests your innate talent and training to overcome a challenge. These depend on one of your attributes. When asked to make a **Check**:

  1. The GM determines the [Difficulty](#difficulty), which [Attribute](pages/characters/attributes.md) applies, and if you are proficient
  1. Roll a d20
  2. Add your [Attributes](pages/characters/attributes.md)
  3. Add your [Proficiency](pages/rules/proficiency.md) if you are proficient:
    1. If the total is greater than the difficulty you succeed
    2. If it is equal to or less you fail

Rolls can be modified by [Advantage/Disadvantage](pages/rules/advantage.md) or disadvantage.

| Easy              | 10          |
| Medium            | 15          |
| Hard              | 20          |

For example, Roche is attempting to fast-talk a suspicious guard. The GM asks him make a [Cunning](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=cunning) [Check](pages/rules/rolling/checks.md) with Deception Skill, against a difficulty of 13. Roche rolls an 8. His [Cunning](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=cunning) is +2 and he is proficient in Deception so he gets a total of 12.

He fails the roll, and the guard remains unconvinced.
