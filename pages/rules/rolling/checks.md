# Checks

Rule

A **Check** tests your innate talent and training to overcome a challenge. When asked to make a **Check** the GM determines the [Difficulty](#difficulty), which [Attribute](../../pages/characters/attributes.md) applies, and if you are proficient.

Roll a d20 and add your [Attribute](../../pages/characters/attributes.md). And your [Proficiency](../../pages/rules/proficiency.md), if you are proficient:

<div class="example-roll">
  <div class="roll">
    <img src="assets/images/d20.svg" style="width: 100px;">
    <span class="result">12</span>
  </div>
  +
  <span class="bonus"> <span class="caption">Attribute</span></span>
  +
  <span class="bonus"> <span class="caption">Proficiency</span></span>
</div>

  1. If the total is greater than the [Difficulty](#difficulty) you succeed
  2. If it is equal to or less you fail
  3. Rolls can be modified by [Advantage/Disadvantage](../../pages/rules/advantage.md)

For example, Roche is attempting to lift a carriage trapping an ally. The GM asks him make a **Medium (15)** [Mighty](../../pages/characters/attributes.md?id=might) [Athletics](../../pages/characters/skills.md#athletics) **Check**. Roche rolls an 8. His Might is +2, his Proficiency is +2, and he is proficient in Athletics so he gets a total of 12.

He fails the roll, and isn't strong enough to lift the carriage.

<div class="example-roll">
  <div class="roll">
    <img src="assets/images/d20.svg" style="width: 100px;">
    <span class="result">8</span>
  </div>
  <span class="bonus">+2 <span class="caption">Cunning</span></span>
  <span class="bonus">+2 <span class="caption">Proficiency</span></span>
  =
  12
</div>
