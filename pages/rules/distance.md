# Distance

Rule

Rather than track precise numbers, **Three Meet** uses 4 abstract ranges for measuring distances: **Close**, **Nearby**, **Far-Away** and **Distant**.

This system is designed to support the narrative ‘theatre of the mind’ style of play, and is less concerned about tracking squares and fiddly distances.

The following table is a rough guide to actual distances:

| Close | Nearby | Far Away | Distant |
| ----- | ------ | -------- | ------- |
| 0-5ft | 5-60ft | 60-120ft | 120ft+  |

## Difficult Terrain

Rule

Adventuring rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. A typical environment contains difficult terrain.

Movement over **Difficult Terrain** takes twice as long.
