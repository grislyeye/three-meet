# Usage Die

<p class="subheading">Rule</p>

</header>

**Usage Die** are used to represent consumable or limited **Resources**, such as ammo or coins. **Usage Die** can be d4s, d6s, d8s, d10s, d12s and d20s (expressed as Ud4, Ud6, etc.).

When you **Tap** a resource, the usage die is rolled. If the roll is 1-2 you **Deplete** the resource. When you do, you successfully use the resource, but the **Usage Die** is downgraded to the next lower die in the following chain:

Ud20 → Ud12 → Ud10 → Ud8 → Ud6 → Ud4

 * I you **Deplete** a Ud4, you fail to use the resource and the resource is **Exhausted** and disappears.
 * Certain rules allow you to **Replenish** a **Resource**, restoring it to its original **Usage Die**.
