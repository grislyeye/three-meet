# Usage Die

Usage die are used to represent consumable or limited resources. Usage die can be **d4s**, **d6s**, **d8s**, **d10s**, **d12s** or **d20s**.

You **tap** a resource to use it. When you **tap** a resource you roll its usage die.

If the roll is 1-2 then the usage die is downgraded to the next lower die in the following chain:

d20 > d12 > d10 > d8 > d6 > d4

When you roll a 1-2 on a **d4** the resource is **exhausted** and cannot be **tapped** any more. It disappears and is removed from play.
