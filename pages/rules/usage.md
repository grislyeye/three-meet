**Usage Die** are used to represent consumable, or limited. **Usage Die** can be d4s, d6s, d8s, d10s, d12s and d20s. When that you **Tap** that resource, the usage die is rolled.

If the roll is 1-2 you **Expend** the resource, and the **Usage Die** is downgraded to the next lower die in the following chain:

d20 > d12 > d10 > d8 > d6 > d4

When you roll a 1-2 on a d4 the item is **Exhausted** and disappears.
