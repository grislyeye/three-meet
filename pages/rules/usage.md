# Usage Die

<p class="subheading">Rule</p>

</header>

**Usage Die** are used to represent consumable, or limited resources, such as ammo or coins. **Usage Die** can be d4s, d6s, d8s, d10s, d12s and d20s (expressed as Ud4, Ud6, etc.).

When you **Tap** a resource, the usage die is rolled. If the roll is 1-2 you **Expend** the resource. When you do, two things happen:

 1. You fail to use the resource
 2. The resource **Usage Die** is downgraded to the next lower die in the following chain:

Ud20 → Ud12 → Ud10 → Ud8 → Ud6 → Ud4

I you **Expend** a Ud4, the resource is **Exhausted** and disappears.
