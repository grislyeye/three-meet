# Luck

**Luck** represents fortune's favour, your natural talent, or your raw confidence. All seasoned characters start with some **Luck**. Otherwise they wouldn't be around in the first place.

**Luck** is a [usage die](pages/rules/usage-die.md) resource and starts at **d10**. Every time you want to **test your luck** you can roll your **Luck**. If you succeed, you gain [advantage](pages/rules/advantage.md) on the next roll.

Some people just seem to glide through life. The know a little about everything, have natural charm or are just really, really fortunate. During [character creation](pages/characters/creating.md) you can declare your character is **lucky** and forfeit your [background's](pages/backgrounds/index.md) attribute bonus. If you do so, your **Luck** starts at **d20**.

When you exhaust your **Luck** you are **out of luck**. You're a dead man walking and all [checks, saves and attacks](pages/rules/rolling.md) have [disadvantage](pages/rules/advantage.md).

Be warned: **Luck** never goes up, it only goes down.
