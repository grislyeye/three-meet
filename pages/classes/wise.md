#### Minor Enchantment

<p class="subheading">1st-level Sorcerer spell</p>

</header>

You intone unspeakable words that trigger command impulses in your victims. You can use an action to do one of the following:

  * You attempt to charm a target you can see within range. It must make a [Wisdom](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=wisdom) [save](pages/rules/rolling.md?id=saves). It does so with advantage if you or your allies are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it can't attack you and you have advantage on any social [check](pages/rules/rolling.md?id=checks) with it. When the spell ends, the target knows it was charmed by you.

  * You make your opponents fall asleep for 1 minute. Roll 5d8. You can target a number of creatures within 90 feet of you whose total [Health](pages/combat/health.md) are equal to or lower than this result.

#### Minor Ward

You touch a willing creature (including yourself) who isn't wearing armour, and a protective ward surrounds it until the spell ends. The target's [Defence](pages/combat/defence.md) becomes 13 + its [Wisdom](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=wisdom) attribute. The spell ends if the target dons armour or if you dismiss the spell as an action.
