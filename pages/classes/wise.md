### Stricken

You command dark forces to afflict an enemy within range that you can see. Make a ranged [spell attack](pages/combat/attacks.md?id=spell-attacks) against a target within 120 ft. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 damage.

### Sorcery

You have knowledge of magical spells and command arcane forces. You can cast one of the spells below once per rest. Each spell takes an action to cast.

#### Spell: Baleful Touch

You channel baleful energies through your body that withers the flesh of those it comes into contact with. Make a melee [spell attack](pages/combat/attacks.md?id=spell-attacks) against a target. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 damage.

#### Spell: Dark Whispers

You summon dark spirits that whisper in the ear of a creature of your choice that you can see. The target must succeed on a [Wisdom](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=wisdom) [save](pages/rules/rolling.md?id=saves) or take 3d6 damage

#### Spell: Minor Enchantment

You intone unspeakable words that trigger command impulses in your victims. You can use an action to do one of the following:

  * You attempt to charm a target you can see within range. It must make a [Wisdom](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=wisdom) [save](pages/rules/rolling.md?id=saves). It does so with advantage if you or your allies are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it can't attack you and you have advantage on any social [check](pages/rules/rolling.md?id=checks) with it. When the spell ends, the target knows it was charmed by you.

  * You make your opponents fall asleep for 1 minute. Roll 5d8. You can target a number of creatures within 90 feet of you whose total [Health](pages/combat/health.md) are equal to or lower than this result.

#### Spell: Minor Ward

You touch a willing creature (including yourself) who isn't wearing armour, and a protective ward surrounds it until the spell ends. The target's [Defence](pages/combat/defence.md) becomes 13 + its [Wisdom](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=wisdom) attribute. The spell ends if the target dons armour or if you dismiss the spell as an action.
