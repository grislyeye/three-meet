| 1st   | +2          | Archetype, Surge, Proficient: [Might](pages/characters/attributes.md?id=might) [saves](rules/rolling.md?id=saves), Proficient: Athletics |

### Surge

You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to fuel feats of strength. You start with two such surge effects: Second Wind and an effect determined by your archetype.

When you use your Surge, you choose which surge effect to use. You must then finish a rest to use your Surge again.

#### Surge: Second Wind

On your turn, you can regain [Health](pages/combat/health.md) equal to 1d10 + your level.

### Archetype

Choose an archetype and gain its features. The Mighty archetypes include: **Brawler**.

## Brawler

You fight quick and dirty, preferring to use your fists and whatever else you can get your hands on. There is no honour is such combat, and you're not above a dirty trick or two.

| Level | Archetype Features |
| ----  | ------------------ |
| 1st   | Brawl, Surge: Flurry of Blows, Proficient: Intimidation |

### Brawl

You can make a **Brawl Attack (Melee 1d6, Versatile 1d8)** when unarmed. If you successfully hit with your brawl attack you can use your [bonus action](pages/combat/actions.md?id=bonus-actions) to attempt to [grapple](pages/combat/attacks.md?id=grapple) or [shove](pages/combat/attacks.md?id=shove) the target.

### Surge: Flurry of Blows

Immediately after you [attack](pages/combat/attacks.md) on your turn, you can make two brawl attacks as a [bonus action](pages/combat/actions.md?id=bonus-actions).
