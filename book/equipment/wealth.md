# Wealth

Wealth is measured in consumable treasures and containers for coins or jewels, such as pouches of coins and gold statues. These are rated using [usage die](/rules/usage.md).

For example, you might have a d4 small pouch for of copper pieces or 6 pouches stuffed full of gold coins (d6 each).

      <td>Small chest full of gold</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="numbers">d12</td>
      <td>Large chest full of jewels</td>

You roll the treasure item's usage die when you spend it. Each [item](/equipment/items.md) or service has a die cost. You cannot buy an item that costs more than the usage die of the treasure you are using.

<aside>

## Variant: Large Wealth

You automatically buy items more than two levels down the usage die chain, without having to roll.

For example, if you have a d10 chest of gold coins, you do not have to roll your usage die if you buy a d4 dagger.
