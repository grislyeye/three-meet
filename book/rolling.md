# Rolling

In Three Meet you'll be asked to roll d4s, d8s, etc.. However, there are three main rolls:

 * ability checks
 * attack rolls
 * saving throws

These depend on one of your ability scores. When asked to make these rolls:

  1. roll a d20
  2. add your ability score
  3. You might also add your proficiency bonus, if you are [proficient](proficiency.md).

For example, Maeve is asked to make a Cunning saving throw. Maeve's Cunning is +2, they're proficient in Cunning and their proficiency bonus is +2. They roll a d20 for a result of 12 and add a +4, getting 16.
