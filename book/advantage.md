# Advantage/ Disadvantage

Some spells and special abilities can give you **advantage** or **disadvantage** on an ability check, saving throw or attack roll. The Judge may also determine if circumstances

When you roll with advantage or disadvantage:

 1. Roll two d20s instead of one
 2. If you have advantage use the higher of the rolls
 3. If you have disadvantage use the lower of the rolls
 4. Advantage and disadvantage do not stack: you either have one, or you don't
 5. Advantage and disadvantage cancel out: if you have both you roll normally
