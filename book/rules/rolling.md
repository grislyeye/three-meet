# Rolling

In Three Meet you'll be asked to roll d4s, d8s, etc.. There are three main rolls:

 * ability checks
 * attack rolls
 * saving throws

These depend on one of your ability scores. When asked to make these rolls:

  1. Roll a d20
  2. Add your ability score
  3. Add your proficiency if you are [proficient](proficiency.md).

For example, Maeve is asked to make a Cunning saving throw. Maeve's adds their Cunning (+2), and their Proficiency (+2) as they are proficient in Cunning saving throws. They roll a d20 for a result of 12 and add a +4, getting 16.
