# Usage Die

Usage die are used to represent consumable, limited item and resources. Usage die can be d4s, d6s, d8s, d10s, d12s and d20s. When that item or resource is used its usage die is rolled.

If the roll is 1-2 then the usage die is downgraded to the next lower die in the following chain:

d20 > d12 > d10 > d8 > d6 > d4

When you roll a 1-2 on a d4 the item is expended and the character has no more of it left.
