# Luck

Luck represents fortune, the favour of the gods, or natural talent. You do not roll Luck like other ability scores.

Instead, you gain a number of **luck points** equal to your Luck score (to a minimum of 1). You can spend a luck point to gain proficiency on any ability score, attack roll or saving throw you are not already proficient in.

You regain your luck points after a [long rest](/rules/rest.md).
