        <h3>Rolling</h3>

        <p>The three main rolls of the game: <strong>ability checks</strong>, <strong>saving throws</strong> and <strong>attack rolls</strong> — rely on the four ability scores. In all cases you roll a 1d20 and add the relevant ability score to the roll, and your proficiency bonus if it applies.</p>

        <h4>Advantage and Disadvantage</h4>

        <p>Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll.</p>

        <p>When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p>
        <p>If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.</p>

        <p>If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.</p>

        <h4>Luck</h4>

        <p>Luck is the exception and it is only add to rolls under special circumstances:</p>

        <p>All characters start play with a number of <strong>luck points</strong> equal to 1 + their luck ability score. They can spend a luck point on any ability check, saving throw or attack roll and gain advantage. Your luck points refresh after a long rest.</p>
