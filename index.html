        <h2>Ratfolk of the Undercity</h2>
      
        <p>For centuries the vermus have lurked in the undercity sewers unbeknownst to the citizens above. But soon their wretched existence may be revealed...</p>

        <p>This monograph is part of <strong>Grisly Eye Games&#39;</strong> <q>Threats</q> series. Each monograph introduces new, setting-neutral monsters to supercharge your campaign.</p>

        <p><strong>Threats: Vermus</strong> introduces the vermus, a new threat for 1st-2nd level characters. This 8 page supplement includes a detailed description of the vermus with illustrations, 4 new monster stats (CR 1/4 to 1) and adventure seeds.</p>

        <h2>The Vermus</h2>

        <div class='columns'>
          <p>The vermus (or <em>ratfolk</em>) are a race of intelligent, rodent-like humanoids that live in the sewers and catacombs of the Undercity. Vermus stand 3-4 feet tall upright, with grey, brown or black pelts, long snouts, dark eyes and long, furless tails. Paranoid and cowardly, they avoid direct confrontation preferring to attack from the shadows.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Feral Wretches.</em></strong> Ratfolk are prone to inbreeding and parasites and often carry mange and disfigurements. Furthermore, life in the Undercity is hard: living conditions are, at best, unsanitary. Most vermus do not live long and only the wiliest and most vicious survive. It is fortunate that they breed so quickly otherwise they might have been wiped out ages ago.</p>

          <p><strong><em>The Hidden-Folk.</em></strong> The vermus have secretly lived alongside mankind for centuries. In ages past they were routinely exterminated for fear of plague. Only after centuries of hiding has humanity forgotten them: vermus only venture to the surface under cover of darkness. And if they believe they have been discovered they quickly cover their tracks. Nests are emptied and moved. Witnesses quietly disappear.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Scavenger Society.</em></strong> Vermus live off food waste and whatever else they can steal or scavenge. With their nimble paws and natural stealth, they make ideal thieves. In fact, <q>scavenging</q> is a point of pride for the vermus. Those individuals who steal most from the surface to provide for their nests are accorded the most respect.</p>

          <p>In recent decades, ratfolk have taken to stealing more than just food and trinkets. From the shadows they watch men with envious eyes. They marvel at their clothes and tools. They look on in amazement at their sorcery. They dress in human styles (albeit smaller and ragged). They wield kitchen knives and other, stolen or discarded tools as weapons. Even their names are misappropriated, human words like Cobble, Bite and Foul.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Shrouded Nests.</em></strong> The nest is the writhing, beating heart of vermus society. It is family, clan and kingdom to the vermus, all rolled into one. Here the ratfolk live literally cheek-to-jowl, so close at times the walls seem made of fur. Everything seems to happen in one big, chaotic jumble: eating, sleeping, even pup rearing.</p>

          <p>A typical nest consists of a large, central chamber surrounded by a warren of tunnels and smaller chambers. Nests are normally built around disused, underground constructions such as crypts or forgotten temples. Protecting the nest is vital to survival so any entrances will be cleverly hidden and trapped. Often the only tell is the detritus vermus seem to attract. Used to a life of filth, ratfolk seem unaware of the mess they create.</p>

          <h3>Skulks</h3>

          <p>Blindness is a common abnormality for vermus born into the perpetual gloom of the Undercity. Sightless ratfolk quickly adapt, their heightened senses giving them an unnerving ability to <q>see</q> in the dark.</p>

          <p>These creatures are trained as <q>skulks</q>: the deadly and silent assassins of the ratfolk. With impassive brutality and unnerving accuracy, skulks strike from the shadows to eliminate threats to the nest. They are most frequently sent out to <q>disappear</q> witnesses who threaten to reveal the existence of the vermus.</p>

          <h3>Plague Wracks</h3>

          <p>The ratfolk's hardy constitution make them resistant to diseases. However, sometimes them succumb to plagues but do no die. Instead, they live on as foul <em>wracks</em>.</p>

          <p>Delirious with fever, eyes rolling, fur wet with sweat, mouths foaming, the ravings of wracks are considered sacred by the vermus. It is thought their feverish mental state allows them to commune with dark spirits and gods of pestilence. At once holy men and pariahs, the vermus care for them but keep them muzzled and chained. In times of need they work them into a frenzy to release against their foes.</p>

          <div class="aside">
            <h4>Dungeon Master&#39;s Notes</h4>

            <p>The elves have their woods, the dwarves their gold. The vermus have their secrets. Use vermus to represent secrets both figuratively and literally. Use vermus as part of your campaign conspiracies. Use vermus as an urban substitute for goblins or kobolds. But do use them.</p>

              <p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em></p>
            </header>

            <p>This decaying volume appears to be a simple trade guide for rat-catchers. However, an observant reader (DC 15 passive Perception check) will discover it contains a detailed report about the vermus. You can reference this book whenever you make an Intelligence check to investigate the vermus. When you do double your proficiency bonus on that check.</p>

            <p>This book is notorious amongst the vermus and they will do anything to locate and destroy copies.</p>

        <h3>Rat Kings</h3>

        <div class='columns'>

          <p>Typically nests are ruled through intimidation by strong-minded individuals. The dynamics change in the larger nests, however. The highly complex, erratic natures of larger ratfolk communities means they can&#39;t be controlled by a single vermus.</p>

          <p>Instead they are ruled by the legendary ratfolk <q>kings</q>: a council of vermus <q>nobles</q> whose tails have grotesquely fused, linking their nervous systems to create a sort of hive intelligence of unnaturally high cunning. These creatures squat upon foul thrones made of their own, worm-like tails. Their legs waste away from lack of use, and they rely on their subjects to do everything for them. </p>

          <p>Rat kings sit at the centre of their nests and are always accompanied by a swarm of lesser vermus, fetching food or running errands. These vermus will instinctively sacrifice themselves to protect their king, quickly piling on any attackers. </p>

          <h4>Old Spit</h4>

          <p>Deep in the catacombs of the Undercity plots Old Spit. Spit has ruled his nest, in one form or another, for centuries. His mix of ruthlessness and extreme paranoia has served his people well, keeping them hidden from the surface dwellers.</p>

          <p>With spies all over the city and a shrewd eye for trouble, Spit likes to eliminate problems before they happen. Each night he sends out his skulk assassins: maybe to poison a burgher here. Or cut some nobles throat there. This way he prunes any long-term threats to his nest, keeping the humans away from the catacombs and his brood safe.</p>

          <p>So far no one has noticed the conspiracy of silence surrounding these deaths...</p>

          <h3>Vermus Plots</h3>

          <p>The vermus have lived in secret beneath the city for centuries, feeding off the surface world in parasitic harmony. Every now and then someone stumbles onto a vermus nest or a rat king gets ambitious which inevitably leads to conflict:</p>

          <p><strong>The Cull.</strong> A deadly plague strikes the city, escaping every quarantine and striking down rich and poor alike. The plague is being spread by a rat king seeking to exterminate the city-folk above and claim the city for itself.</p>

          <p><strong>Abandon Ship.</strong> Men and women are disappearing in a line that seems to be moving from the center of the city outwards. Something in the Undercity has the vermus spooked and they&#39;re leaving the city en-masse, killing all witnesses in their path. Can their deadly exodus be stopped? And what is scaring the ratfolk so much? </p>

          <p><strong>Rat Hunt.</strong> The vermus are uncovered: a house collapses over a ratfolk nest and hundreds of witnesses see the creatures scurrying away. Across the city panic sets in and the characters are recruited to exterminate the vermus before plague can spread. Will the characters carry out their mission or find a way to prevent a genocide?</p>

          <p><strong>The Rat Queen Fief.</strong> While exploring the remote wilderness the party comes across a seemingly deserted city. When they set-up camp for the night they realise the city is far from empty: swarms of vermus appear under the cover of darkness and hound the characters through the empty streets. The city is claimed by a Rat Queen who will keep its secret at all costs. Can the characters fight or talk their way out? Will they discover what happened to the previous inhabitants?</p>

          <p><strong>Letters from the Rat King.</strong> A corrupt merchant hires the characters to find out who has been blackmailing him. Slowly they uncover a Rat King plotting to control the criminal underworld of the city using a network of blackmail. Can its machinations be stopped?</p>

          <p><strong>The Bitter Prince.</strong> A mysterious bard call himself <q>The Prince</q> appears in town. He carries a magic flute that allows him to summon and control the vermus. So armed he goes on a vengeful killing spree. What does he want and can he be stopped?</p>

          <p>The layout and style of this monograph was based on the <strong>Dungeon Masters Guild</strong> <em>Adventure Template</em>. The main font is <em>Alegreya</em> by Juan Pablo del Peral which is more elegant and legible than the template default. It is also hosted on Google Webfonts and supports "true" italics and bold. The title font was <em>Andada SC</em>.</p>

          <p>This document was published using HTML, JavaScript and CSS, and composed using open source, web technologies including Node.js, Grunt, NPM, Bower, SASS, Polymer and Yarn. The PDF was generated using Chrome's PDF print preview feature. The monster stat blocks were generated using a web component of my own creation, based on Val Markovic's open source <em>Statblock5e</em>.</p>

          <p>I'd also like to thank our playtesters who got down and dirty in the sewers to make sure the vermus work at your table. The roll call includes:</p>

          </ul>

          <p>Lastly I'd like to thank our talented artists, George Howard and Daniel Walthall, who brought the vermus to wretched life. Please help support them by considering them for your own commissions.</p>
